# TonemapToy

TonemapToy is a simple web-based tool for testing GLSL-based global tonemappers.

Inspired by but not affiliated with ShaderToy.

GLSL version is ES 3.0 (with WebGL2).

For additional test images, have a look at [Troy Sobotka's testing imagery repository](https://github.com/sobotka/Testing_Imagery).
